  Additional Resources
  Each of the objectives represents a task which you will need to complete using the available cluster and server(s). Read each objective carefully and complete the task specified.

  For this question, you will need to ssh into the ectd1 server. You can do so using the hostname (i.e., ssh etcd1).

  Note: You cannot ssh into another node from any node other than the root node. Once you have completed the necessary tasks on a server, be sure to exit and return to the root node before proceeding.

  If you need to assume root privileges on a server, you can do so with sudo -i.

  You can run the verification script located at /home/cloud_user/verify.sh on the etcd1 server at any time to check your work!

  Back Up the etcd Data
  From the exam server, log in to the etcd1 server and back up the etcd data to a file located at /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db.

  Note: On the etcd1 server, you can find certificates which you can use to authenticate with etcd in /home/cloud_user/etcd-certs.

  Restore the etcd Data from the Backup
  On the etcd1 server, restore your etcd data from the backup file at /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db.

  ##Answer:

  Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) - Practice Exam Part 4
    Introduction
    This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. You will be presented with tasks to complete as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKA exam. Good luck!

    Solution
  Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

    ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
    Back Up the etcd Data
  From the terminal, log in to the etcd server:

    ssh etcd1
  Back up the etcd data:

    ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \
    --endpoints=https://etcd1:2379 \
    --cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \
    --cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \
    --key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
    Restore the etcd Data from the Backup
  Stop etcd:

    sudo systemctl stop etcd
  Delete the existing etcd data:

    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
  Restore etcd data from a backup:

    sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \
    --initial-cluster etcd-restore=https://etcd1:2380 \
    --initial-advertise-peer-urls https://etcd1:2380 \
    --name etcd-restore \
    --data-dir /var/lib/etcd
  Set database ownership:

    sudo chown -R etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
  Start etcd:

    sudo systemctl start etcd
  Verify the system is working:

    ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get cluster.name \
    --endpoints=https://etcd1:2379 \
    --cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \
    --cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \
    --key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
