#Question:
  Additional Resources
  This question uses the acgk8s cluster. After logging in to the exam server, switch to the correct context with the command kubectl config use-context acgk8s.

  Each of the objectives represents a task which you will need to complete using the available cluster and server(s). Read each objective carefully and complete the task specified.

  For some objectives, you may need to ssh into other nodes or servers from the exam server. You can do so using the hostname/node name, i.e. ssh acgk8s-worker1.

Note: You cannot ssh into another node, or use kubectl to connect to the cluster, from any node other than the root node. Once you have completed the necessary tasks on a server, be sure to exit and return to the root node before proceeding.

  If you need to assume root privileges on a server, you can do so with sudo -i.

  You can run the verification script located at /home/cloud_user/verify.sh at any time to check your work!

  Create a Multi-Container Pod
Create a pod called multi in the baz namespace. Run two containers in this pod, with the following images (in order):
  nginx
  redis
  Create a Pod Which Uses a Sidecar to Expose the Main Container's Log File to `stdout`
  Create a pod called logging-sidecar in the baz namespace.
Run a container in this pod with the busybox image and the following command: sh -c while true; do echo Logging data > /output/output.log; sleep 5; done.
  Add a second container called sidecar to the pod which also uses the busybox image, and reads the output from the first container, as well as prints it to the container log (console).

#Answer::

  Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA): Practice Exam: Part 7
  Introduction
  This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam. You will be presented with tasks to complete, as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes, to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKA exam. Good luck!

  Solution
  Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

  ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
  Create a Multi-Container Pod
  Switch to the acgk8s context:
  kubectl config use-context acgk8s
  Create a YAML file named multi.yml:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: multi
    namespace: baz
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      - name: redis
        image: redis
  Save the file:
  ESC
  :wq
  Create the multi-container pod:
  kubectl create -f multi.yml
  Check the status of the pod:
  kubectl get pods -n baz
  Check the status of the exam objectives:
  ./verify.sh
  Create a Pod Which Uses a Sidecar to Expose the Main Container's Log File to Stdout
  Create a YAML file named logging-sidecar.yml:
  vim logging-sidecar.yml
  In the file, paste the following:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: logging-sidecar
    namespace: baz
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: busybox1
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo Logging data > /output/output.log; sleep 5; done']
        volumeMounts:
          - name: sharedvol
            mountpath: /output
      - name: sidecar
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -f /input/output.log']
        volumeMounts:
          - name: sharedvol
            mountPath: /input
    volumes:
      - name: sharedvol
        emptyDir: {}
  Save the file:
  ESC
  :wq
  Create the logging-sidecar pod:
  kubectl create -f logging-sidecar.yml
  Check the status of the pod:
  kubectl get pods -n baz
  Check the logging-sidecar logs:
  kubectl logs logging-sidecar -n baz -c sidecar
  Check the status of the exam objectives:

  ./verify.sh
